# Magento_Product_Show_footer_Plugin
By this plugin, you can see randomly a product and try to add it to cart. 
I tried to place it in the footer of Magento page.
In the backend of project and admin panel, I design admin panel to disable or enable plugin.
In the block folder, the main file was responsible to fetch data from repository and another function is to make product cart from helper class.
